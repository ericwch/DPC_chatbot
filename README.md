# DPC facebook chatbot
Chatbot for Unimelb Drawing and Painting Club facebook page. 
# Motivation 
At the beginning of the semester we were often asked the same set of questions by new members. Thought it'd be so much easier if we set up a bot.
# How it works
The chatbot uses regex to identify keywords and the facebook implemented nlp to identify meaning
in the recieved message. Concat the corresponding responses for the identified keywords or
meanings and send it to the client.

For server set up refer to Facebook messenger platform doc: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/introduction
